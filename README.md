# Customer segmentation based on RFM and KMeans algorithm

### Project Overview
RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary) is a widely used method for evaluating the value of customers based on important factors such as the most recent purchase time (Recency), purchase frequency (Frequency), and transaction value (Monetary).

After obtaining the RFM indices, I will apply the KMeans algorithm - a powerful clustering algorithm - to segment customers into groups with similar characteristics. 
### Data Sources
The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "data.xlsx" file.
# Tools
